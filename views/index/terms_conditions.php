                                <h4>(3)	Licence to use website</h4>
                                <p>Unless otherwise stated, we or our licensors own the intellectual property rights in the website and material on the website. Subject to the licence below, all these intellectual property rights are reserved.
                                   You may view, download for caching purposes only, and print pages from the website for your own personal use, subject to the restrictions set out below and elsewhere in these terms of </p>

                                <li type="1">There are two main purposes of website terms of use: first, they set out the contractual framework for the use of the website; second, they fulfil some of the legal obligations placed upon some kinds of businesses and websites. Our terms of use template is intended for use on websites focused on England and Wales; it can, however, be adapted for use in other jurisdictions â€“ although this should only be done by someone with the requisite familiarity with the relevant law of the other jurisdiction. The template is designed for some of the most common kinds of websites: information sites, online brochures/adverts for products and services, personal websites and similar kinds of sites. It contains optional provisions for websites with restricted access and/or user generated content. It is not on its own sufficient for use on websites which collect personal information (which will also require a privacy policy of some kind) or for ecommerce sites (ie those involving payment in relation to goods or services, which will also require legal provisions relating specifically to the goods or services that can be bought on the website). Websites with unusual or non-standard features should always use bespoke terms of use. The website terms of use template will need to be edited before it is ready for use. Square brackets in the document indicate the sections which need or are likely to need to be edited. However, you should carefully review the whole document to ensure that it meets with your requirements. If you have any doubts, you should seek professional advice.</li>
                                <li type="2">The completed website terms of use should be easily accessible on your website, preferably from every page. Ideally, from a legal perspective, users should be asked to expressly agree to these terms (eg by clicking an "I agree" button). This is rarely done in relation to general website terms of use. If, however, users have to register to enter a restricted area of the website or to use functionality in the website, you should ensure that they agree to the terms of use (eg by clicking "I agree" on an electronic version of the terms of use). You should retain evidence of the agreement of the terms by each user.</li>
                                <li type="3">The use of websites by minors can be legally problematic. There are a number of different legal issues. For example, under English law, contracts may be unenforceable against minors. Another issue concerns data protection. The law of data protection imposes additional burdens in relation to the processing of any personal data of a minor and in relation to the processing of personal data provided by a minor. The effects of the law of indecency may also depend upon whether a website is accessible by minors. Obviously, the inclusion of a requirement in your terms of use that minors refrain from using a website is no guarantee that they will do so. Where your website is directed at, or likely to be used by, minors, we recommend that you seek specialist legal advice.</li>
                                <li type="4">The inclusion of this statement in your website legal documents will not necessarily satisfy the requirements of the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 as regards consent to the use of cookies. Guidance concerning methods of obtaining such consent is included on the Information Commissioner's website (http://www.ico.gov.uk). Details of cookie use should be set out in the privacy policy or cookies policy.</li>
